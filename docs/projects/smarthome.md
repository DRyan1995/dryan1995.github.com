## Brief Introduction

####【Abstract】


Our design is based  on the platform of Altera DE-2 development board based on WiFi communication of smart home model to simulate the home environment, controlling a number of peripheral modules, and complete the communication between board(server) and  mobile phones(client) . Through this course design, I have been familiar with the usage of HDL, qsys,  quartus 13 ,NIOS II Eclipse and a series of development environment.

In this design, we use Verilog HDL to prepare the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor for reading temperature and humidity data , and control some surroundings such as breathing LEDs (PWM), a small fan; using Qsys to build a NIOS II core platform; NIOS II and WIFI module communication protocol written by C language, sending instructions to the client and decode the instructions sent by the client, after which parsing operation after a series of peripheral modules; using JAVA language and Android Studio platform to complete the building of the Android client; SOCKET communication based on TCP protocol to complete the two-way communication between the client and the server; finally using quartus13.0 to complete the final design.

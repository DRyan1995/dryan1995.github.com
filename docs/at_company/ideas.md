# WHEN I TEMPORARULY GIVE UP WEB LEARNING

**Nothing is still and everyone needs to look forward**

Upset as I was at the time when saying goodbye to my first startup, I realize it's the time for myself to look and move forword.

With plenty of time and energy spent in the company, lots of experiences and skills are gained for myself at the same time. Coding language like JavaScript, JQuery, CoffeeScript, css, less, php are learnt in the 2 months period. After the 2 mounth learning, at least, I am able to design a total web on my own, which really makes sense to me.

Fortunately, I received the offer from University California, Riverside several days ago, which determines my mind to get down to my study in the next two months. First I need to complete my courses of this term perfectly. Second, I cannot forget these courses that needs to be made up this term!! Last, I wanna have a fabulous end(You know my meaning..)
